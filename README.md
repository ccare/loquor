Loquor handles calls to an API via an ActiveRecord-style interface. It is currently configured for the Meducation API but could easily be changed for any other API. It allows you to access show/index/update/create actions with simple calls like `MediaFile.find(8)`, without having to worry about HTTP, JSON or anything else.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'loquor'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

To get going, you will want to set up some configuration variables.
``` ruby
Loquor.config do |config|
  config.access_id  = "Username"
  config.secret_key = "SecretKey1929292"
  config.endpoint   = "http://www.meducation.net"
end
```

If you're not using this for Meducation, then edit the [mappings here](https://github.com/meducation/loquor/blob/master/lib/loquor.rb#L16).

Now you can make requests to get, create, update, destroy and list a range of objects, likein the same way you would interactive with an ActiveREcord object.

For example, you can get search objects using where:

```ruby
items = Loquor::User.where(email: "jeremy@meducation.net").where(name: "Jeremy")
# => [{id: 2, name: "Jeremy Walker"}, {id: 3, name: "Malcolm Landon"}]
```

Items responds to all the enumeration methods on Array. e.g.

```ruby
items.each do |user|
  p "The user with id ##{user['id']} is #{user['name']}."
end
```

The returned objects can be accessed as hashes (using either strings or symbols), or using dot notaton. e.g.:

```ruby
user = User.where(foo: 'bar').first
user.name
user['name']
user[:name]
```

You can use `select` (for api calls that support it), which specifies which fields to return.

```ruby
items = Loquor::User.select([:id, :name])
# => [{id: 2, name: "Jeremy Walker"}, {id: 3, name: "Malcolm Landon"}]
```
You can use `find` and `find_each` (which sends requests to the API in batches of 200)
```ruby
Loquor::User.find(2) # => {id: 2, name: "Jeremy Walker"}
Loquor::User.find_each do |user|
  # ...
end
```

You can also create users using the normal ActiveRecord method:
```ruby
Loquor::User.create(name: "Jeremy Walker", email: "jeremy@meducation.net") # => {id: 2, name: "Jeremy Walker", email "jeremy@meducation.net"}
```
